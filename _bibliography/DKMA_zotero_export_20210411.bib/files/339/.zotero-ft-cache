Abstract

The overwhelming majority of scientific knowledge is published as text, which is difficult to analyse by either traditional statistical analysis or modern machine learning methods. By contrast, the main source of machine-interpretable data for the materials research community has come from structured property databases 1 , 2 , which encompass only a small fraction of the knowledge present in the research literature. Beyond property values, publications contain valuable knowledge regarding the connections and relationships between data items as interpreted by the authors. To improve the identification and use of this knowledge, several studies have focused on the retrieval of information from scientific literature using supervised natural language processing 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , which requires large hand-labelled datasets for training. Here we show that materials science knowledge present in the published literature can be efficiently encoded as information-dense word embeddings 11 , 12 , 13 (vector representations of words) without human labelling or supervision. Without any explicit insertion of chemical knowledge, these embeddings capture complex materials science concepts such as the underlying structure of the periodic table and structure–property relationships in materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an unsupervised method can recommend materials for functional applications several years before their discovery. This suggests that latent knowledge regarding future discoveries is to a large extent embedded in past publications. Our findings highlight the possibility of extracting knowledge and relationships from the massive body of scientific literature in a collective manner, and point towards a generalized approach to the mining of scientific literature.

Extended data figures and tables
Extended Data Fig. 1 Chemistry is captured by word embeddings.

a , Two-dimensional t -distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) projection of the word embeddings of 100 chemical element names (for example, ‘hydrogen’) labelled with the corresponding element symbols and grouped according to their classification. Chemically similar elements are seen to cluster together and the overall distribution exhibits a topology reminiscent of the periodic table itself (compare to b ). Arranged from top left to bottom right are the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, and noble gases while the trend from top right to bottom left generally follows increasing atomic number (see Supplementary Information section  S4 for a more detailed discussion). b , The periodic table coloured according to the classification shown in a . c , Predicted versus actual (DFT) values of formation energies of approximately 10,000 ABC 2 D 6 elpasolite compounds 40 using a simple neural network model with word embeddings of elements as features (see Supplementary Information section  S6 for the details of the model). The data points in the plot use fivefold cross-validation. d , Error distribution for the 10% test set of elpasolite formation energies. With no extensive optimization, the word embeddings achieve a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.056 eV per atom, which is substantially smaller than the 0.1 eV per atom error reported for the same task in the original study using hand-crafted features 40 and the 0.15 eV per atom achieved in a recent study using element features automatically learned from crystal structures of more than 60,000 compounds 41 .
Extended Data Fig. 2 Historical validations of functional material predictions.

a – c , Ferroelectric ( a ), photovoltaic ( b ) and topological insulator predictions ( c ) using word embeddings obtained from various historical datasets, similar to Fig. 3a . For ferroelectrics and photovoltaics, the range of prediction years is 2001–2018. The phrase ‘topological insulator’ obtained its own embedding in our corpus only in 2011 (owing to count and vocabulary size limits), so it is possible to analyse the results only over a shorter time period (2011–2018). Each grey line uses only abstracts published before a certain year to make predictions. The lines show the cumulative percentage of predicted materials studied in the years following their predictions; earlier predictions can be analysed over longer test periods. The results are averaged in red and compared to baseline percentages from all materials. d , The target word or phrase used to rank materials for each application (based on cosine similarity), and the corresponding words used as indicators for a potentially existing study.
