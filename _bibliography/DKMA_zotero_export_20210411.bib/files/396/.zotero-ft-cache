    Abstract: This paper analyzes and compares different deep learning loss functions in the framework of multi-label remote sensing (RS) image scene classification problems. We consider seven loss functions: 1) cross-entropy loss; 2) focal loss; 3) weighted cross-entropy loss; 4) Hamming loss; 5) Huber loss; 6) ranking loss; and 7) sparseMax loss. All the considered loss functions are analyzed for the first time in RS. After a theoretical analysis, an experimental analysis is carried out to compare the considered loss functions in terms of their: 1) overall accuracy; 2) class imbalance awareness (for which the number of samples associated to each class significantly varies); 3) convexibility and differentiability; and 4) learning efficiency (i.e., convergence speed). On the basis of our analysis, some guidelines are derived for a proper selection of a loss function in multi-label RS scene classification problems.
