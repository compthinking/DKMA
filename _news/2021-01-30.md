Hello all,
Given the poll in @215 and some of my own time constraints, I'm going to move the 'B' lecture to Tuesdays at 9am.
I realize this will mean some people who could make B before now may not be able to or will need to leave early.  
This schedule has benefits for other students in different time zones which are important to consider. 
Hopefully, everyone can understand this and make an adjustment.
All lectures will continue to be recorded and posted on Youtube afterwards.
I will also be having weekly office hours for the whole class (not by House). 
See below for all the details.

Prof. Crowley
