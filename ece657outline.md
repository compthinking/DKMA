description: Engineers encounter data in many of their tasks, whether the sources of this data may be from experiments, databases, computer files or the Internet.  There is a dire need for effective methods to model and analyze the data and extract useful knowledge from it and to know how to act on it. In this course you will learn the fundamental tools for organizing cleaning and extracting useful features from data and preparing it for data science and machine learning tasks including supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning approaches. Students will gain practical experience with coding and analysis through assignments. Research students will have opportunity to connect course material to their research as a project instead of some of the assignments. Research students will also each carry out an in-depth review of a recent research paper as this is critical in keeping up with this literature.
