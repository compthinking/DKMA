Student performance for the course will be evaluated via **tests (done alone)**, **assignments (done in pairs or alone)**, and **participation**. For this online term all tests **will be carried out online** over a designated *period of 2-3 days* where students will have a *2-3 hour window* of their choosing to either submit answers (as a pdf or image to CROWDMARK) or complete an interactive test (via LEARN).

## Information and Rules for all Tests:

- Tests are to be done alone
- Test questions are not to be discussed online, or on stackexchange, or on piazza (or slack (or discord (or reddit (or newsgroups (or irc (or any other online forum))))))
- That being said, you can *read* online resources about the question to help answer it if you do not understand enough to do so, or if the slides and lectures have not succeeded in helping you understand how to answer it. Just as you can consult a textbook in an in-person test, you can consult online, static resources now to figure out your response. 
  - But you will have limited time to do the test, so try to be prepared to simply answer directly from your own experience.
- **Keep in mind** that the tests are worth much less than assignments in this course, so treat it as a challenge to excel and show your ability at the subject on your own.

## Test 1

**Scope:** Content from live lectures and self-study videos from *weeks 1 - 4* inclusive.

**Topics:** Types of Data, Data Cleaning, Probabilities, Parameter Estimation (Bias, Logistic Regression, MLE, MAP), kNN, Experimental Methodology Train/Test/Validate,  Ablations, Hypoth Test, Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods.

**Question Types:**

- True/False (possibly with a short one-sentence explanation)
- Multiple Choice : choose the right answer (or best answer) out of 4-5 choices
- Data/Output/Algorithm Matching:
  - given a visualization of a dataset and the resulting classification pattern of an algorithm, identify the algorithm that was used
  - or distinguish the parameters of that algorithm from a set of choices
- Derivation of an MLE/MAP estimator:
  - given a described classification problem
  - given the relevant distributions, and being told which parameters are known and unknown
  - Derive the MLE estimator in closed form (if possible)
  - Derive the MAP estimator in closed form (if possible)
  - NOTE: for this question you will have an example posted onto learn, and there will also be a question on assignment 2 to practice on beforehand (as well as endless websites online with more examples of this very standard technique)
