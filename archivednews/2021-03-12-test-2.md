# ECE 657A - Winter 2021 - Test 2

**Scope:** Content from live lectures and self-study videos from *weeks 5 - 9* inclusive (but not including Deep Learning)

**Topics:** Streaming Ensemble Methods. Feature Extraction, Dimensionality Reduction, Word Embeddings, SVM, Clustering Algorithms and Evaluation Measures, Anomaly Detection

**Date and Time:**

Was originally scheduled for March 11, will now be **March 18-20**
\- you will have a 72 period to *start* the test, March 18-20
\- then you will have a 3 hour window to actually do the test once you start

The test will either be on Mobius (if we can get it working :)) or as a scanned paper/tablet submission on Crowdmark (just like the assignments but handwritten).

**Question Types:**

- True/False (*possibly* with a short one-sentence explanation)
- Multiple Choice: choose the right answer (or best answer) out of 4-5 choices
- Data/Output/Algorithm Matching:
  - Given a visualization of a dataset and the resulting output of an algorithm, identify the algorithm that was used
  - Draw your own representation of the expected algorithm output onto the data. This could be:
    - The orientation of the first and second components of the corresponding subspace of that algorithm (PCA, FDA, LLE)
    - The dividing line or class/cluster boundary for desginated points.
  - or distinguish the parameters of that algorithm from a set of choices
- Calculations
  - Performance Metrics for various problems, given the numbers, calculate the measure correctly, possibly provide an explanation of the meaning or relative values between instances
  - Some of the internal calculations used in clustering/classification algorithms such as
    - K-means : mean point of a cluster, distance of point to other means, change in cluster assignment
    - DBScan : local 
- Theoretical Question
  - Regarding Feature Extraction or Dimensionality Reduction
