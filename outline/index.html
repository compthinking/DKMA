<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>

<p>Engineers encounter data in many of their tasks, whether the sources of this data may be from experiments, databases, computer files or the Internet.  There is a dire need for effective methods to model and analyze the data and extract useful knowledge from it and to know how to act on it. In this course you will learn the fundamental tools for assessing, preparing and analyzing data. You will learn to design a data and analysis pipeline to move from raw data to task solution. You will learn to implement a variety of analytical and machine learning algorithms to including supervised, unsupervised and other learning approaches. Students will gain practical experience with coding and analysis through assignments. Research students will have opportunity to connect course material to their research as a project instead of some of the assignments.</p>

<h3 id="recommended-background">Recommended background:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Data Structures and Algorithms, Basic Programming Skills (Python especially) and Basic Knowledge of Probability and Statistics Theory</em></li>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment:</h2>

<p>The goal of this course is to help students learn how to <strong>analyse and prepare</strong> data, <strong>describe and apply</strong> theoretical concepts in Data Science and Machine Learning, <strong>design</strong> data processing pipelines and <strong>implement</strong> important machine learning algorithms on a range of datasets and tasks. This course will be a success if students can use these skills in their future endeavours, research and employment. To assess this, students will complete assignments that require all of these skills on real datasets and they will also complete small tests focussing on the theoretical and design aspects of these skills.</p>

<h3 id="weighting-of-assessments">Weighting of Assessments</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>65% Assignments</strong> (three or four assignments, done in pairs or alone):
    <ul>
      <li>Assignments will arise from the major component topics of the course, some will buid on previous assignment outcomes.</li>
      <li>Possibility to have later assignments as Kaggle-style competitive submissions (note: vast majority of grade will be based on performance and correcteness rather than based on competitive performance)</li>
      <li>Assignments will involve multiple skills:
        <ul>
          <li>mathematical analysis of data and results</li>
          <li>logical design and clear description of a expeirmental methodology</li>
          <li>programming various algorithms for processing, training and analysis of data to achieve given tasks (Programming will be in Python using libraries such as sci-kit learn and tensor flow)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Late Assignments:
        <ul>
          <li>Assignment due dates will be at midnight on the designated date.</li>
          <li>Late assignments will have the following penalties from the assigned grade:
            <ul>
              <li>6 hours (0%)</li>
              <li>6-24 hours (5%)</li>

              <li>&gt;48 hours (100%)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If you know <em>ahead of time</em> that you will not be able to make the deadline do to <em>serious</em> health or personal issues contact the professor to ask for an exception.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>35% Tests</strong>
    <ul>

<p>If you’re experiencing a crisis and feel unable to cope and Campus Wellness is closed, contact any of these after-hours supports: EmpowerMe (1-833-628-5589), Good2Talk (1-866-925-5454) or Here 24/7 (1-844-437-3247). They are available at any time of the day or night to help.</p>

<h2 id="policy-and-rules">Policy and Rules</h2>

<h3 id="fair-contingencies-for-emergency-remote-teaching">Fair Contingencies for Emergency Remote Teaching</h3>

<p>We are facing unusual and challenging times. To provide contingency for unforeseen circumstances, the instructor reserves the right to <em>modify</em> course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines <em>with due notice to students</em>. In the event of further challenges, the instructor will work with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty.</p>

<h3 id="online-academic-integrity">Online Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check www.uwaterloo.ca/academicintegrity/ for more information.]</p>

<p>All students are expected to work individually, or in pairs as described for assignments, and submit their own original work. Under Policy 71, the instructor may have follow-up conversations with individual students to ensure that the work submitted was completed on their own. Any follow up will be conducted remotely (e.g., MS Teams, Skype, phone), as the University of Waterloo has suspended all in-person meetings until further notice.</p>

<h3 id="grievance">Grievance:</h3>

<p>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4, http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy70.htm. When in doubt please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

<h3 id="discipline">Discipline:</h3>

<p>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing academic offenses and to take responsibility for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offense, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offenses (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course professor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offenses and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student Discipline, http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm. For typical penalties check Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties, http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/guidelines/penaltyguidelines.htm.</p>

<p>Plagiarism-detection software may be used on any submitted work.</p>

<h3 id="appeals">Appeals:</h3>

<p>A decision made or penalty imposed under Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances (other than a petition) or Policy 71, Student Discipline may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to Policy 72, Student Appeals, http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm.</p>

<h3 id="note-for-students-with-disabilities">Note for students with disabilities:</h3>

<p>The Office for Persons with Disabilities (OPD), located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with the OPD at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
